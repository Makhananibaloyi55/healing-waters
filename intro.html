        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Healing isn't always quick. sometimes it's a slow, quiet process- a day-by-day walk through pain, confusion, and tears. But even in our deepest suffering, there is hope. there is peace waiting for us. There is healing.</p>

        <p>This book is a journey. It's for the broken, the grieving, the forgotten, and the wery. It's for you. Each page is a step toward wholeness, inspired by the world of God and grounded in real emotions we all face.</p>


        <blockquote>
            "He heals the brokenhearted and binds their wounds." - psalm 147:3
        </blockquote>

        <p> you are not alone. you are not too far gone. your heart matters. And with every verse, every reflection, we pray you'll feel God drawing you closer to  healing.</p>
