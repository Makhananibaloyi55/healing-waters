        <h2>When It's Hard to Pray</h2>
        <p>There are days when the soul feels like it's dragging through thick mud. Prayers feel empty, songs sounnd distant, and the light of hope seems too far to reach. It's like carrying a weight that no one can see.</p>

        <p>you love God , but you feel numb. you want to believe things will get better, but you're too tired to fight. you're not alone in that. many people silently carry spiritual exhaustion. But the thruth is - even when we are silent, God still hears the cry of our hearts.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. - Mattew 11:28"
        </blockquote>

        <p>sometimes, the most powerful prayer is simply: <strong>"Lord, help me."</strong> He understands. he drwas near not to condemn, but to comfort. he offers rest- not judt for your body, but for your soul</p>

        <p>This chapter is for amyone whose spirit feels tired, God sees your heaviness. and He's still walking with you, step , breath by breath.</p>
