        <h2>Releasing What Hurts</h2>
        <p>Forgiveness is not easy. It's one of the hardest steps on the road to healing. Especially when the pain is deep and the person who hurt you never said sorry. It feels unfair. Like letting them go means letting them win.</p>

        <p>But Forgiveness isn't for them- it's for you. it's about choosing freedom over bitterness, peace over revenge. it doesn't erase the past. But it opens the door for your future to be free of it.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in christ forgave you." - Ephesians 4:32
        </blockquote>

        <p>God knows how hard it is to forgive. He doesn't ask you to do it alone. He offers His strength. when you forgive, you're not sayong what happened was okay. you're saying it will no longer control you life.</p>

        <p>This chapter is for the ones still holding pieces of pain, waiting for justice. May this be the moment you let go and allow healing to full begin.</p>
