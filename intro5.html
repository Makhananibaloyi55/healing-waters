        <h2>When You Feel Like Giving Up</h2>
        <p>strength doesn't always look like confidence. sometimes , Strength is getting out of bed when your heart is breaking. It's facing the day even when you're unsure you'll make it through. It's choosing faith even if your hands are trembling.</p>
        
        <p>you've made it this far - and that means strength  already lives in you. But there is a greater strength availble, one that never runs out. God offers based on His promise.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength, They will soar on wings like eagles." - Isaiah 40"31
        </blockquote>

        <p>Let this chapter reminds you that you are not weak for needind help. Asking for strength is a sign of wisdom, nit failure. There is grace for your tired spirit, and there is power waiting for you in prayer.</p>

        <p>This is not the end of your story. It's the beginning of your rise, There is more ahead - more peace, more healing amd more joy.</p>
