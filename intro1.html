        <h2>The Pain That No One Sees</h2>
        <p>some wounds are visible. others are hidden deep in the soul-those wounds that don't bleed but hurt just the same. The pain of betrayal. of being rejected. of being abandoned by those who promised to stay.</p>

        <p>I carried those wounds in silence. smiling outside, but breaking inside. people would ask, "Are you okay?" And I'd lie, "yes." Because how do you explain that your heart feels like shattered glass?</p>

        <blockquote>"The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit." - psalm 34:18</blockquote>

        <p>Healing begins when we stop pretending we're fine. When we cry out to God, He listens. when we admit our brokenness, He doesn't turn away. He come close. And your healing has already begun.</p>
