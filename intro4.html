        <h2>Freeing youself from yesterday</h2>
        <p>The past has a strong grip. Regert, shame, guilt- they can follow you like shadow that never rest. you reply moments, wonder what you could've done differently, and sometimes wish you could go back and change it all.</p>

        <p>But healing asks you to stop carring yesterday on you back. you were never meant to live stuck in memories that bring you pain, God invities you into a future that isn't defined by your worst days.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "forget the former things; do not dwell on the past, see, I am doind a new thing!" - Isaiah 43:18-19
        </blockquote>

        <p>When God looks  at you , He doesn't see the mistakes, He sees your heart, your growth,and the beauty rising from the ashes. The past may have shaped you, but it does not own you.</p>

        <p>This chapter is a reminder that you can leave the prison of yesterday and step into the promised of today.</p>
